Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide unparalleled audio latency and computational power. This makes them a better fit for real-time audio processing than traditional CPUs for many applications. However, programming them is extremely complex and out of reach to non-specialized engineers as well as to most people in the audio community. That's where Faust comes to the rescue! Programming FPGAs with Faust (which is an accessible programming language for real-time sound synthesis and audio processing) will allow you to explore new audio DSP applications potentially involving hundreds of audio channels, ultra-low audio latency, etc. Using a Zybo ARM/FPGA SoC Development Board which will be provided to you as part of a lab kit, you will learn how to easily program your own Faust audio signal processing applications on an embedded Linux environment offering the unmatched performances of an FPGA. Covered topics During this course, as an introduction to FPGAs, we will first describe in details the ins and outs of this platform : how they work, their general purpose, and why they are a great fit for audio hardware and software development. We will dive in audio development on FPGAs using Syfala to compile our first baremetal audio programs from regular Faust DSP code . We will then generate a graphical user interface (GUI) to control it in real-time. Finally, we will demonstrate how to build and use a custom-made embedded Linux distribution directly on the board . This will allow us to use more advanced control protocols such as MIDI , Open Sound Control ( OSC ), HTTP , etc. By the end of the workshop, you should have a good understanding of the possibilities that such a platform affords in the context of real-time audio processing. Instructors Maxime Popoff Pierre Cochard -- Research engineer, team Emeraude -- INRIA Lyon (France) Lab Kit The workshop registration fee includes a $... lab kit containing all the required elements (i.e., Digilent Zybo Z7-XX ARM/FPGA SoC Development Board, ...) to Additional Information This workshop is intended for musicians, makers, engineers, computer scientists, etc. Previous background in computer programming and sound synthesis/processing is preferred. Participants should bring their own laptop.
